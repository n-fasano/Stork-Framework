# Stork

This is a very simple reactivity framework I made when I was in bootcamp.  
The goal was not to beat other existing frameworks, I just thought "Hey, I can build that!".  

It also contains an `$element` class that you'll find to be very similar to jQuery.  
It changed structure a lot before I started using version control, which is why you'll find an unused `FilmController` and `Film`.
